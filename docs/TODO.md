# Project TODOs

## Core Features
- [x] Build the "Oefenen" (practice) mode including gentle feedback flows.
- [x] Create the "Hoe deed je het?" progress/leaderboard screen.
- [x] Implement the "Instellingen" settings screen (audio, difficulty presets, profielen, taal, support).

## Platform & Availability
- [ ] Package the game as a PWA / web distribution so it can run in the browser.

## Profiles & Progress
- [x] Add avatar selectie per profiel.
- [ ] On game startup, when there is no profile, we want to welcome the user and let them easily create a first profile. The target audience are kids between 6-10, so we want to make it as easy as just asking for their firstname and let them select a avatar.
- [x] Provide a way to reset profiles and scores from within the UI.


## Localization
- [x] Introduce multi-language support (strings scheiden, NL/EN toggle toepassen).
- [x] Ontwerp een lichte vertaalstructuur (resource-bestanden, fallback-logica) en koppel deze aan `SettingsScene`.

## Polish & Future Ideas
- [ ] Consider syncing coins/profiles across devices.
- [ ] Add unlockable themes or rewards purchasable with coins.
- [ ] Add favoriete tafels per profiel.
- [ ] Profiel avatar selectie knoppen verbeteren.
- [x] Move 'back'-button on leaderboard to top-left corner, move title a bit to the right
- [ ] Make leaderboard page also scrollable like 'settings'
- [ ] Settings screen must be improved (layout polish, better support CTA flow)
